					<h3>What is this?</h3>
					<p>{{ service_name }} is a server instance of <a href="https://github.com/SadaleNet/simple-python-s3-file-hosting">Simple Python S3 File Hosting</a> developed by <a href="https://sadale.net">Sadale</a>.

					<h3>Why another file hosting service?</h3>
					<p>Unlike most other file hosting services, this one does not host files on the same server as the website. Instead, it hosts files on cloud-based AWS S3-compatible object storage. Compared with conventional file-based storage, using object storage is more scalable and possibly more cost-efficient. By off-loading the file storage to the third party, we let the object storage cloud service provider to take care of the scaling of the service. The processing power spent on our VPS remains minimum, enabling us to serve far more clients compared with file-based storage. </p>
